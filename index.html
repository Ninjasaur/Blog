                My PC Build
            </h1>
            <p>
                Recently, I decided to build my own computer.
                I have known many people who have conquered this
                task and I admire them. Starting out, I had very 
                little knowledge on the specifics, which led me to
                do immense amounts of research and consulting.
                With a combination of YouTube videos and asking 
                an assortment of questions to my brother (thanks
                bro), I progressed my knowledge on the subject.
                Probably my most handy tool during that process
                was PC Part Picker. I highly recommend using that
                website for anyone attempting to build a PC at 
                home. One amazing feature you get when using PC 
                Part Picker is it checks for compatiblility 
                between all of the parts that you choose. Sure,
                you could buy all the parts for a predetermined
                build, but this gives you the ability to choose
                exactly what you want and make sure it all works
                together. Personally, I decided to start with an 
                already build part list courtesy of Paul's
                Hardware that can be found<a 
                href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/paulshardware/saved/tnv9Jx"> here.</a>
                For my needs, I determined that it would be smart to keep the CPU, 
                Motherboard, and Memory that had already been chosen out.
                After watching a few videos of mid-range parts lists, I found that those three
                parts were commonly used and considered reliable. When it came to storage,
                I wanted to take a different route. I'd  say that storage was the thing I
                researched the most second only to the case. I figured it would be smart
                to get an initial SSD for main storage, and get an additional hard drive
                that would hold all the extra stuff such as games, documents, etc. The 
                only other part that I decided I wanted from the base list I was using was
                the Graphics Card. Nobody would call it top of the line, but it gets the job
                done. If I was a more avid gamer I would've sprung for a 1080, but alas that
                is not the case. For the Power Supply, I had heard good things about SeaSonic
                as a brand, so I decided to switch for one of those that was fully-modular. The 
                case was a whole other story. This is the part that is completely up to you 
                for looks and for what you would like it to hold. I spent ages clicking through
                different cases. I knew for sure that I would like a black case, but besides that
                I was just looking for any around $60 that I liked the look of. The one that I 
                decided upon was a Corsair with a plastic side panel so that you could see the 
                goods when peering inside. I already had one monitor, so I decided to go dual
                and picked up another one, this time curved. About a week later after ordering, 
                I received a threatening amount of boxes. Honestly, I was so giddy that I was
                tempted with doing an unboxing video. Let's be real, who actually wants to see
                a teenage girl ubox computer parts? Anyway, I piled all of the boxes in my room
                and got to work. Since I had absolutely no clue what I was doing I put on a 
                video that was a step by step process on how to build a PC. Personally, I wouldn't
                consider that cheating since everyone needs a little help. It was incredibly 
                imforative and even though I didn't have the same parts as that in the video, 
                I could figure the rest out myself. You can find the video I used<a 
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhX0fOUYd8Q&t=46s"> here.</a> It was 
                entertaining as well as descriptive. The first mishap that I encountered
                was right after I installed the CPU. I pulled the CPU fan out of the box,
                and unbeknowst to me, there was a layer of thermal paste on the bottom. with
                this lack of knowledge, I held the fan by the side that had the thermal paste,
                and well, made a mess. Luckily, it didn't cause any damage except a -2 from my
                already low common sense. While I'm on the subject, I do have to say that 
                installing the CPU was incredibly enjoyable. The look of the CPU was sleek,
                and installing it inside of the Motherboard was very satisfying. After that, 
                I installed the memory and then placed the Motherboard inside of the case. The 
                next task was the Power Supply. Eh, just, so many cords. So many. One thing 
                that made me incredibly paranoid was plugging cords into the Motherboard. The pins
                are so fragile, that if you break any, you are outta luck. Configuring all of the 
                cords was not easy, especially since I didn't have a lot of space in my case for 
                cable management. I mostly shoved everything into the bottom and it worked. The 
                next struggle I had was to do with the storage. For some reason, I couldn't find
                a place to put my SSD. The case manual indirectly pointed a spot where it was supposed
                to go, but that didn't work out. Because of that, I had to do a little improvisation.
                Since my SSD was 2.5", I used a velcro strap to keep it stable on one of the 3.5"
                trays. I mean, it works. Then for the hard drive. I was able to fit that into another
                tray. Next, was the graphics card. Pretty easy installation as far as that goes. Then
                came the big reveal. I plugged the power source into the wall and clicked the on button 
                and...nothing happened. I immediately started panicking because I knew I did something
                wrong. The first thing that I did was unplug the power source from all of the cables.
                I wanted to check that my power source was not faulty, in case that was what was wrong, 
                so with directions from a YouTube video, I used a paperclip to test it, and it did in 
                fact work. I plugged everything in the exact same way as before and yet again it did
                not turn on. The next step I took was going through each and every cord and making sure 
                they were all connected to the right thing the right way. I unplugged every cord very
                carefully and plugged it back it to make sure the connection was secure. The only other 
                thing I did was play around with switching the cord from the hard drive. After doing 
                that lengthy ordeal, I set out again to attempt to turn it on. To my amaze, the LEDs 
                turned on and all of the fans started whirring! I had suceeded...or so I thought. After 
                it was confirmed that my computer did indeed turn on, I plugged in my monitors. One of
                them uses an HDMI and the other a DP. Guess what? No signal input. Now, I knew it wasn't 
                the cables or the monitors that were faulty because I had just tested them both with my
                laptop. Being extremely confused, I set out to Reddit for advice. With an incredibly 
                vague description, I asked for help. Within 20 minutes, I got a few responses. As I 
                scrolled down it hit me. The last comment said I probably plugged the cables into the 
                motherboard and not the graphics card. Heh, whoops. I felt incredibly dumb at the moment
                and I still do. I had no clue that was where you plugged the cables in, especially since
                the video that I was relying on was just about the PC build. Well, I plugged the cables 
                into the right place and she worked. I simply installed Windows via an external DVD player 
                that I had and we were gucci. Fast forward to now, a few weeks after the build, and I am
                exceptionally happy. She has not been named yet, but I'll know it when I hear it. The 
                games I have played have run very nicely courtesy of my graphics card. It was a very fun 
                experience and I hope I can do it again in the future. You can find my full list of parts
