                My PC Build
            </h1>
            <p>
                Recently, I decided to build my own computer.
                I have known many people who have conquered this
                task and I admire them. Starting out, I had very 
                little knowledge on the specifics, which led me to
                do immense amounts of research and consulting.
                With a combination of YouTube videos and asking 
                an assortment of questions to my brother (thanks
                bro), I progressed my knowledge on the subject.
                Probably my most handy tool during that process
                was PC Part Picker. I highly recommend using that
                website for anyone attempting to build a PC at 
                home. One amazing feature you get when using PC 
                Part Picker is it checks for compatiblility 
                between all of the parts that you choose. Sure,
                you could buy all the parts for a predetermined
                build, but this gives you the ability to choose
                exactly what you want and make sure it all works
                together. Personally, I decided to start with an 
                already build part list courtesy of Paul's
                Hardware that can be found<a 
                href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/paulshardware/saved/tnv9Jx">here.</a>
                For my needs, I determined that it would be smart to keep the CPU, 
                Motherboard, and Memory that had already been chosen out.
                After watching a few videos of mid-range parts lists, I found that those three
                parts were commonly used and considered reliable. When it came to storage,
                I wanted to take a different route. I'd  say that storage was the thing I
                researched the most second only to the case. I figured it would be smart
                to get an initial SSD for main storage, and get an additional hard drive
                that would hold all the extra stuff such as games, documents, etc. The 
                only other part that I decided I wanted from the base list I was using was
                the Graphics Card. Nobody would call it top of the line, but it gets the job
                done. If I was a more avid gamer I would've sprung for a 1080, but alas that
                is not the case. For the Power Supply, I had heard good things about SeaSonic
                as a brand, so I decided to switch for one of those that was fully-modular. The 
                case was a whole other story. This is the part that is completely up to you 
                for looks and for what you would like it to hold. I spent ages clicking through
                different cases. I knew for sure that I would like a black case, but besides that
                I was just looking for any around $60 that I liked the look of. The one that I 
                decided upon was a Corsair with a plastic side panel so that you could see the 
                goods when peering inside. I already had one monitor, so I decided to go dual
                and picked up another one, this time curved. About a week later after ordering, 
                I received a threatening amount of boxes. Honestly, I was so giddy that I was
                tempted with doing an unboxing video. Let's be real, who actually wants to see
                a teenage girl ubox computer parts? Anyway, I piled all of the boxes in my room
                and got to work. Since I had absolutely no clue what I was doing I put on a 
                video that was a step by step process on how to build a PC. Personally, I wouldn't
                consider that cheating since everyone needs a little help. It was incredibly 
                imforative and even though I didn't have the same parts as that in the video, 
                I could figure the rest out myself. You can find the video I used<a 
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhX0fOUYd8Q&t=46s">here.</a> It was 
                entertaining as well as descriptive. The first mishap that I encountered
                was right after I installed the CPU. I pulled the CPU fan out of the box,
                and unbeknowst to me, there was a layer of thermal paste on the bottom. with
                this lack of knowledge, I held the fan by the side that had the thermal paste,
                and well, made a mess. Luckily, it didn't cause any damage except a -2 from my
                already low common sense. While I'm on the subject, I do have to say that 
                installing the CPU was incredibly enjoyable. The look of the CPU was sleek,
                and installing it inside of the Motherboard was very satisfying. After that, 
                I installed the memory and then placed the Motherboard inside of the case. The 
                next task was the Power Supply. Eh, just, so many cords. So many. One thing 
                that made me incredibly paranoid was plugging cords into the Motherboard. The pins
                are so fragile, that if you break any, you are outta luck. Configuring all of the 
                cords was not easy, especially since I didn't have a lot of space in my case for 
                cable management. I mostly shoved everything into the bottom and it worked. The 
                next struggle I had was to do with the storage. For some reason, I couldn't find
                a place to put my SSD. The case manual indirectly pointed a spot where it was supposed
                to go, but that didn't work out.
